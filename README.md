Waearing mask became mandatory in many countries during the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
Ensuring people wearing mask is a tedious and time consuming job which could be facilitated and autmated with image processing and machine leraning techniques. 
Camera streams are widely available in indoor environments which can be used for object detection and image processing. 
Convolutional Neural Networks are successfully applied in image classification and object recognition task in various application areas.
There are already trained and openly available general purpose convolutional neural networks which can be used as an initial version for specific applications. 
The InceptionV3  Neural Network architecture was used to tailored to determine whether a mask is weared or not using transfer learning techniques. 
This paper describes the implementation of a mask recognition software using a Convolutional Neural Network and Variational Autoencoder.
